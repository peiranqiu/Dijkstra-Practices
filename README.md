Constraint-based Dijkstra Algorithm implementation, real world application and visualization.

Collaborators: @FreddyDoesIT @karenca0 @peiranqiu



In our project, we implemented original Dijkstra’s algorithm and its two modified versions with by-pass nodes or must-go nodes. Also, we chose three different typical real life scenarios which apply Dijkstra’s algorithm and had them implemented in our project. Finally, we implemented a visualization tool for generating the result for Dijkstra’s algorithm and its applications. 

This project has been tested with environment of MacOS and IntelliJ IDE. Programming language: Java

Fork the project to your workspace, open your IDE, such as IntelliJ, click `Open or Import`, select `Desktop` and then `Network-Final-Project`.

Open `Visualization` to get started. You will see a interactive terminal below:

```
0. Base Dijkstra Algorithm
1. Dijkstra with Must Go Certain Nodes
2. Dijkstra with Bypassing Certain Nodes
3. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
4. Network Delay Time
5. The Widest Path Between Two Hosts

Choose from above options to visualize:
```
